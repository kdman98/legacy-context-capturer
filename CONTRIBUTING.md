### Creating New Agents

Agents must include frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description of what this agent does
---

# Agent Name

Your agent implementation here...
```

### Creating New Commands

Commands must include frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: command-name
description: Brief description of what this command does
---

# Command Name

Your command implementation here...
```

### Agent Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should do one thing well
2. **Clear Inputs/Outputs**: Document expected inputs and outputs
3. **Scoped Awareness**: Support both full-codebase and scoped analysis
4. **JSON Communication**: Use structured JSON for agent-to-agent communication

### Testing Your Changes

1. Install your modified plugin locally
2. Test on a real codebase (preferably a complex one)
3. Verify all commands work as expected
4. Check that generated CLAUDE.md files are useful and accurate

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add inline documentation for complex logic
- Include examples where helpful
- Keep agent/command descriptions concise but clear
